# DS320project
There are two separate coding files. The first python code was utilized in google colab. We uploaded the csv files in colab and used pandas to read and create dataframes for them. Then, these csv files (from data source 2) were manipulated and cleaned to fit the needs for joining together with the other data source in sql coding. After being cleaned and manipulated through Python, all three csv files were checked to make sure there were not any other missing values, or extra cleaning necessary.

The second file is the sql code. This is where we utilized the roster csv file in code from data source 1 with the three stats csv files from data source 2. We created three semantic mappings one for each csv file in the second source. These mappings had a couple of semantic matches (player name and position) that we utilized to get the data to combine together. When we wanted to compare them and put them in our code, we realized some of the column names had changed slightly at the beginning from being pulled over into SQL. To deal with this issue, we just copied and pasted the column names that it changed and still were able to run the code creating the csv files needed for visualizations.
